# datc_user_interface

## Overview
- datc_user_interface is the software that includes a GUI that can run KR-DATC of KORAS Robotics. It is cross-platform software that runs on Windows and Ubuntu, and user can create TCP socket communication server through datc_user_interface.

---
## Development Environment
- Windows 10
    - Qt 6.6.0
    - MinGW 11.2.0 64-bit
- Ubuntu 22.04
    - Qt 6.6.0
    - GCC 64-bit

---
## Dependencies
- Boost
- libmodbus
- Qt
- Feather-icon
- Noto Sans

---
## Compatible Operating Systems
- Windows 10
- Ubuntu 22.04 (Jammy Jellyfish)

---
## Warning
- KR-DATC is a tooling system that changes and uses various grippers such as pneumatic grippers, 2-finger grippers, and 3-finger grippers. Therefore, there are many different precautions from using general grippers, so please read KORAS Robotics' DATC manual before using this software.

## Build
- You can also build code with the command below via cmake, but it is recommended to build and run using Qt in most environments.
```shell
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
$ make
```

---
## Installation
Download and run compatible files on Windows and Ubuntu respectively from the GitHub Release tab.
- Windows 10
    - run exe file
- Ubuntu 22.04
    - run the shell script file

---
## Troubleshooting
- This section lists solutions to a set of possible errors which can happen when using the datc_user_interface.
#### qt.qpa.plugin error
- If you have seen an error such as "qt.qpa.plugin: Could not load the Qt platform plugin "xcb" in "~/platforms:" even though it was found." when you run the released datc_user_interface on Ubuntu 22.04, you can resolve it in the following way.
```shell
$ sudo apt update
$ sudo apt install pyqt5-dev*
```

## TCP Socket communication
- TCP socket server provided by datc_user_interface transmits status and receives commands through the Json format. The status and command format are as follows.

#### Status from server
- "finger_pos": Finger position of the DATC (0 ~ 1000 (0: closed & 1000: open))
- "motor_cur": Current of the DATC (mA)
- "motor_pos": Position of the motor (deg)
- "motor_vel": Velocity of the motor (rpm)
- "states": Status of the DATC
- "voltage": Voltage of the DATC (V)

```json
{
    "finger_pos":500,
    "motor_cur":79,
    "motor_pos":-1259,
    "motor_vel":0,
    "states":5,
    "voltage":24
}
```

- The states of DATC is as follows.

Bit | Status | Value
---- | ---- | ----
0 | Motor Enable | 0: False, 1: True
1 | Gripper Initialize | 0: False, 1: True
2 | Motor Position Control | 0: False, 1: True
3 | Motor Velocity Control | 0: False, 1: True
4 | Motor Current Control | 0: False, 1: True
5 | Gripper Open | 0: False, 1: True
6 | Gripper Close | 0: False, 1: True
7 | - | -
8 | - | -
9 | Motor Fault | 0: False, 1: True
10-15 | - | -

#### Command to server
- If you want to change modbus address connected to datc_user_interface, send a Json message as below.
```json
{
    "change_slave": <desired_slave_number>
}
```

- If you want to control DATC, check out the list below.
    - If the "command" does not require "value_1" or "value_2", you do not need to send it.

```json
{
    "command": 104,
    "value_1": 500,
    "value_2": 0,
}
```

#### List of "command"
Function | Command | Value 1 (Dec) | Value 2 (Dec)
---- | ---- | ---- | ----
Motor Enable | 1 | - | -
Motor Stop | 2 | - | -
Motor Disable | 4 | - | -
Motor Velocity Control | 6 | Target velocity (rpm) | Target duration (ms)
Motor Current Control | 7 | Target Current (mA) | Target duration (ms)
Change Modbus Address | 50 | Desired address | -
Gripper Initialize | 101 | - | -
Gripper Open | 102 | - | -
Gripper Close | 103 | - | -
Set Finger Position | 104 | 0 ~ 1000 (0: closed & 1000: open)
Vacuum Gripper On | 106 | - | -
Vacuum Gripper Off | 107 | - | -
Set Motor Torque | 212 | Ratio of target motor torque to default torque (%) | -
Set Motor Speed | 213 | Ratio of target motor speed to default speed (%) | -



#### Communication test using 'telnet'
- Activate TCP socket server using datc_user_interface
- Run 'telnet' in terminal (Window / Linux)
- If there is no 'telnet' command in Window OS, you can enable in Control Panel.
```shell
$ telnet localhost <socket_port>
```
- Example (command must be inserted into terminal running telnet)
```json
# Gripper initialize command
{"command":101}
# Gripper Open command
{"command":102}
# Gripper Close command
{"command":103}
# Set Finger Position command
{"command":104,"value_1":500}
```
